# **Data Analysis – Theatrical Kickstarter**
## **Background Breakdown**
The Client’s (Louise) interest was focused on how their own Kickstarter project (Fever) did in comparison to similar theatrical Kickstarter Campaigns. Using data ranging from 2009 to 2017, the goal was to track potential trends in successes and failures to give the Client a solid overview for comparison.
## **Analysis**
Using data containing Kickstarter Campaigns for theatrical productions, specifically plays, from 2009 to 2017, two specific analyses were performed:
#### Analysis 01: Outcomes by Launch Date
The first analysis is a breakdown of Campaign outcomes by launch date, graphed by month (Chart 1.1). By focusing on the monthly success and fail rates over the eight-year span, a trend became observable, allowing particular times of the year to be flagged as preferable for opening a campaign.

### Analysis 02: Outcomes Based on Financial Goals
The second analysis was a breakdown of Campaigns Outcomes based on their financial Goals (Chart 1.2). Using brackets of $4,999 spreads, with brackets dedicated to campaign goals of $1000 or less as well as $50,000 and over, the data set was split into successful, failed, and cancelled projects categories, and the percentage of each category from the total number of campaigns in a particular bracket. For example, the total number of projects with goals of $1000 or less is 186; within this bracket, 141 projects were successful, 45 failed, and 0 were cancelled, which turns into 76% successful, 24% failed, 0% cancelled. These percentages were used to build Chart 1.2.

## **Challenges**
Though I didn’t find any particular part of the data analysis challenging, I believe it would be beneficial to clarify if the Goals and Pledged columns are all meant to be displayed as US Dollars, given the Country and Currency columns (this is also listed under Limitations).
I suppose the most challenging aspect to me is the lack of data regarding the marketing – in a time where Kickstarters and GoFundMes live or die based on the amount of exposure they receive; I think it’s important to determine how campaigns grabbed attention. I don’t believe this is truly possible due to the volume of data and with no way to actually quantify social media outreach (See Limitations as well).
## **Results**
### Outcomes based on Launch Date
As presented above (Chart 1.1), the data displays an increase in successful campaigns beginning in April which sharply spikes in May, going from 56 in March to 71 in April, and 111 in May. The trend dips slightly in June at 100 campaigns, and steadily decreasing as time passes until reaching 59 successful campaigns in September, which is only a little over half the number from May. The trend seems to suggest that late spring to early summer is the ideal time to open a campaign, though other factors should be considered. (See Challenges)
In contrast the failed campaign data spikes from September to October, going from 34 campaigns to 50, before dipping back down in November to 31. This section is also the only portion of the chart where no campaigns are cancelled, though whether this is due to the increase in failed campaigns or not is not something which can be determined using this data set. Overall, autumn and early winter seem to be far less preferable times to open a campaign.
### Outcomes based on Goals
Based on the dataset, campaigns under $10,000 seem to have a higher success rate than most other Goal brackets. Using Chart 1.2 alone, it seems that campaigns with Goals of $35,000 to $49,999 have a similar success rate, but it should be noted that the number of campaigns in these two brackets are far smaller and are therefore rather anomalous. Conversely, we see a sharp dip from the $20,000-$24,999 bracket to the $25,000-$29,999 bracket, with a slight increase into the $30,000-$34,999 bracket. 
## **Limitations**
There are several factors to consider when reviewing the data provided. 
1)	The first, and most important, is that no data is provided on marketing costs; as it stands, the success or failure of a campaign may not involve the variables we targeted at all, but instead rely on previously established audiences, specifically those built through social media accounts.
2)	Second, though the data is divided by country, there was no indication that the Goal or Pledged amounts were in any currency other than dollars, which may skew comparisons, as we did not filter solely by US based campaigns. 
3)	Third, in a similar vein to point one, there is no indication of genre preference, or community engagement within the data set, which can easily affect the outcome of a Kickstarter Campaign.
4)	Fourth, many Kickstarter Campaigns involve tiers for backers – usually broken down by donation size. There is no data regarding this, and such a thing cannot be taken into account using the data provided.
5)	Fifth, based on the spread of the goals, lower budget goals appear to succeed more often than higher budget productions. While understandable in a sociological aspect, there is no way to determine the cause of this data spread.
6)	Sixth, there is no data which indicates the rate of success – some campaigns may have reached their goals in hours, others may have taken weeks. There’s no way to determine this based solely on the data provided.
## **Supplemental Materials**
I believe that rather than using the current chart for Outcomes based on Goals (Chart 1.2), it would be a more realistic view to use the number of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns instead of the percentages; overall I believe using the percentages gives a sense of false optimism. As noted earlier (See Outcomes Based on Goals) the brackets for $35,000-$39,999 and $40,000-$44,999 are just as successful as the bracket for projects $1000 and under, which is true based on percentages. Since the $35,000-$39,999 bracket has 6 projects total, with 4 successful, the percentage of success in this category is 67% - compared to the $1000 and under bracket, which has 186 total projects, 76% of which are successful. But 76% of 186 is 141, which is a far larger number of projects. While the success rates in both categories are high, there’s a vast difference in the number of successful projects – which affects the client’s comparison.
